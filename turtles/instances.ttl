Our solution, Camper+, aims to revolutionize camp management by providing you and your customers with the necessary resources to streamline and enhance the camp experience. Camper+ serves as the ultimate toolkit for camp administrators, offering a comprehensive range of tools to simplify the camp setup process. By utilizing Camper+, administrators can efficiently handle tasks ranging from registration to creating nametags. Unlike traditional methods that often involve multiple external sources, Camper+ consolidates all the required information into a single user-friendly platform.

Camper+ caters to three primary user groups, empowering them with specific features:

    Camp administrators: Benefit from scheduling and people management tools that enable seamless enrollment of students, efficient management of enrolled students, and scheduling activities for different camp groups.
    Camp counselors: Access group management tools such as automatic name-tag generators, attendance tracking systems, schedule viewers, and more to facilitate their responsibilities.
    Parents: Utilize our platform to easily register their children for camp, monitor their activities during the camp, and communicate effortlessly with camp administrators and counselors.
