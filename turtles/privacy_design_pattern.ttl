    msc:problem "Anonymity is a desirable property from the perspective of privacy. However, anonymity may foster misbehaviour, as users lack any fear of retribution.. A service provider can assign a reputation score to its users, based on their interactions with the service. Those who misbehave earn a bad reputation, and they are eventually added to a black list and banned from using the service anymore. However, these scoring systems traditionally require the user identity to be disclosed and linked to their reputation score, hence they conflict with anonymity. This has made, for instance, Wikipedia administrators to take the decision to ban edition requests coming from the TOR network, , as they cannot properly identify users who misbehave.. A Trusted Third Party (TTP) might be introduced in between the user and the service provider. The TTP can receive reputation scores from the service provider so as to enforce reputation-based access policies, while keeping the identity hidden from the service provider. However, this would require the user to trust the TTP not to be a whistle-blower indeed.. How can we make users accountable for their actions while keeping them anonymous?" ;
    msc:requirement "A service provider wants to hold users accountable for their actions while keeping them anonymous." ;
    msc:sim "" ;
    msc:solution "First, the service provider provides their users with credentials for anonymous authentication.. Then, every time an authenticated user holds a session at the service, the service provider assigns and records a reputation value for that session, depending on the user behaviour during the session. Note that these reputation values can only be linked to a specific session, but not to a specific user (as they have authenticated anonymously).. When the user comes back and starts a new session at the service, the service provider challenges the user to prove in zero-knowledge that he is not linked to any of the offending sessions (those that have a negative reputation associated). Zero-knowledge proofs allow the user to prove this, without revealing their identity to the service provider. Different, alternative proofs have been proposed, e.g. prove that the user is not linked to any of the sessions in a set of session IDs, prove that the last K sessions of the user have good reputation, etc.. In practice, more complex blacklisting rules can be applied as well. For instance, several reputation scores can be assigned to the same session, each regarding different facets of the user behaviour. Then, the blacklisting thresholds may take the form of a Boolean combination or a lineal combination over individual session and facet reputation values.. A service provider wants to prevent users who misbehave from accessing the service anymore, without gaining access to their identity." ;

They aim to do so in a manner which is appropriate for the service.. The controller may have relied on op-out mechanics, but now realizes that within the European General Data Protection Regulation (recital 32) 'silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity' no longer constitute consent. Unnecessarily disruptive notice is also not permitted.. The controller may already consider Fair Information Practices, and have an accessible privacy policy.

    msc:implementation "Notification should occur before access where possible, and during or shortly after access if earlier notification is not appropriate. In most cases this means preventing a user's use of a service before allowing the core functionality of the service to run at all. Where some features with variable privacy implications are not essential to the service, they may be provided as optional, defaulting to being disabled.. Users should be informed appropriately, providing both concise and understandable explanations of the personal data acquired, and warnings of the risks involved. The service should make a best effort to ensure that the user understands the implications of consent before commencing or resuming functionality. An effort should also be made to make these notifications non-invasive. Using [Ambient](Ambient-notice) or [Asynchronous Notice](Asynchronous-notice) is one way to achieve this.. Where users choose to be notified less immediately or less often, and after being warned of the risks involved, then the service may store logs of its privacy affecting activities. The user should then be able to retrieve these logs, in a human readable form, at will. As only the user should be able to access these, unless said user provides informed consent otherwise, it should also be secured. Use state of the art means of encryption to do this. If this functionality cannot be done in this manner, due to technical constraints for example, then do not provide logging functionality." ;
    msc:problem "Many systems are designed to be seamless or ubiquitous. However, this can make personal data risks less apparent to the user..

If a concept cannot be reliably conveyed through an icon then it must not be primarily provided as one.. Regardless of whether an icon perfectly conveys a policy, always allow users to investigate further. This can be achieved through hover, click or tap mechanisms.

In a similar vein, detailed descriptions should be comprehensible enough to avoid accusations of being deliberately complex or misleading.. One way in which to explain the risks involved in a process is through example. This is particularly useful in the case of information aggregation. Visualizing the publicity of data is also useful, users can see how visible information would be, or is, to the outside world. Similar decisions by those who choose to set examples may also help in influencing informed sharing behaviour." ;

    msc:consequences "The solution of this pattern will cause users to have a better understanding of the potential consequences of information they share. It may empower some to share knowing they may do so safely, though it will cause less activity overall, as many users will be more careful about what they put online. This is not necessarily a negative consequence, though, since regretted decisions merely garner mistrust and prevent future activity. The controller will be able to introduce new services or update old ones with confidence that users are given the opportunity to consider their decisions in full light of the service's potential consequences.. In addition to lower adoption of risky services, due to public consequences, there will be more cost involved in reworking them. Unattended and system-wide process changes, which negatively affect consequences, will be more difficult to perform. They will not be possible without first disabling the affected services. This is similar to the way some controllers (e.g. Google) handle changes in privacy policies.. Due to more privacy-minded implementations, the system will not anticipate users as easily, though for many this will be a worthwhile tradeoff. While there is cost in creating good solutions, the long-term cost of bad ones (especially in good faith) can often be higher." ;
    msc:constraints "By informing users prior to the activation of any services which use personal data, many aspects of a system are less fluid and thus require additional forethought. Instead of quick integration into the system, which may have come with many privacy oversights, users will be exposed to consequences that they might not have otherwise realized. Care will need to be taken to ensure that these users do not become overwhelmed. As a consequence of better informed users, however, questionable services are more open to scrutiny and thus many shortcuts will no longer be viable." ;
    msc:context "In a situation where user data is collected or otherwise processed, particularly personal data, many users are concerned about the potential repercussions of their actions. Controllers (e.g.~organizations), which have dynamic and evolving services (or products) which users interact with, may share this concern. This may be for legal, ethical, or public appearance reasons.. These controllers also care about the monetary implications of a solution, often including the opportunity cost of informed users against the risks and profits of over-sharing. For-profit organizations regularly want to bolster their market share by overcoming competition with state of the art technologies. These changes may have important consequences, unintentional or otherwise, for users of the system. Controllers want to limit the exposure of these risks to their userbase, even if from a third party, as they are responsible for their data.. Such controllers may already have in place a [Privacy Dashboard](Privacy-dashboard), seeking to complement it, or wish to maintain awareness through various other services. They likely consider [Lawful Consent](Lawful-Consent) and thus seek to ensure that their users are properly and priorly informed before making regrettable decisions. They would nonetheless need to prevent notification fatigue if they were [Preventing Mistakes or Reducing Their Impact](Preventing-Mistakes-or-Reducing-Their-Impact) like in this pattern." ;
    msc:examples "Full adoption of this pattern is not yet commonplace, yet there exist examples of feedback loops to users about activities corresponding to them. This includes notifications such as 'user X wants to access Y', or retrospectively, 'user X accessed Y'. There also exist services which require opt-in, accompanied by explanations of their effects. Conversely telemetry is often opt-out, but occasionally explains what information is at stake." ;
    msc:excerpt "Users need to be informed about how visible data about them is, and what may be derived from that data. This allows them to reconsider what they are comfortable about sharing, and take action if desired." ;
    msc:forcesconcerns "- Users do not necessarily realize the effects of their information sharing, but often want to use new or interesting features. - Some users are discouraged from sharing as they do realize that they are not informed about risks to their privacy, but cannot reasonably change that themselves. - Controllers aim to provide or utilize novel and or competitive services, but explaining potential risks to privacy in those services is often non-trivial and generates a fear of upsetting the userbase and endangering trust. - Some controllers wish to empower users by informing them, but do not want to jeopardize their business model, or ability to process in a timely fashion" ;
    msc:id "AwarenessFeed" ;
    msc:implementation "Every service which makes use of personal information should be investigated by its creators during its creation, or retrospectively if already available. The controller in question is responsible for this. Not only will this affect the user's understanding once presented to them in layperson terms, but it will also allow the controller to realize the privacy impact of their services. This may encourage them to improve the services to be more respecting of privacy. A good solution composes of accessibility, as well as transparency and openness." ;
    msc:longtermeffects "Not only are users often unaware of the potential consequences of their actions, even controllers themselves regularly fail to anticipate how revealing their services can be. While some users approach this uncertainty with caution, others will risk their privacy in hopes of using the services. Though the uncertainty might not prevent their participation, it may still jeopardize their trust in the system." ;
    msc:problem "Users are often unaware of the privacy risks in their data sharing activities, especially risks which are indirect or long-term. How can we best ensure that users become aware of these risks?. This problem is agitated by the organizational aim to provide novel and competitive services while keeping users informed. The difficulty of this is frequently underestimated. The pitfalls controllers face as a consequence manifest both in taking shortcuts and in unexpected long-term effects." ;
    msc:rationale "It is not likely enough that users are informed prior to being provided a service, nor is it reasonable to expect that consent acquired in bulk is properly informed. Consent is not necessarily freely given, either, if the lack of consent presents a wall to a service that the user wants or believes to need.. A concerted effort needs to be made to present the user with unintimidating information relevant to their privacy risks for a service. Providing too much information lessens the chances that the user will read it, while too little information may not properly inform the user. Informing the user too late also puts the user at unnecessary risk.. By making this effort, the controller avoids accusations of negligence in informing their users." ;
    msc:relatedpatterns "Users must be assured of the controller's dedication to transparency and openness, which will be enabled by the consistent presentation of that relevant information, along with other forms of [Building Trust and Credibility](Building-Trust-and-Credibility). As in [Preventing Mistakes or Reducing Their Impact](Preventing-Mistakes-or-Reducing-Their-Impact), both users and controllers themselves need to be aware of the potential for certain services to leak unwarranted personal information. Where the value of the service is nonetheless still high, even after efforts made to reduce leakage risks, users need to be informed enough to choose for themselves exactly what they share (see [Lawful Consent](Lawful-Consent) and [Selective Disclosure](Selective-Disclosure)).. This approach may be partnered with accessible policies, including [Privacy Aware Wording](Privacy-Aware-Wording), [Layered Policy Design](Layered-policy-design), and [Privacy Aware Network Client](Privacy-aware-network-client). It may also benefit from visual cues, like [Icons for Privacy Policies](Icons-for-Privacy-Policies), [Appropriate Privacy Icons](Appropriate-Privacy-Icons) in general, [Privacy Labels](Privacy-Labels), or [Privacy Color Coding](Privacy-color-coding), which aid in alluding to those policies.. This compound pattern benefits from also using [Task-based Processing](Task-based-Processing), where personal data is separated according to purpose. In this case, only use data for which any necessary consent has been granted, and which is within the scope of the personally enabled purposes. This precludes the application of unattended process changes which would induce new consequences.. This pattern _complements_ [Privacy Dashboard](Privacy-dashboard), [Trust Evaluation of Services Sides](Trust-Evaluation-of-Services-Sides), [Appropriate Privacy Icons](Appropriate-Privacy-Icons), [Icons for Privacy Policies](Icons-for-Privacy-Policies), [Privacy Color Coding](Privacy-color-coding), [Privacy Aware Wording](Privacy-Aware-Wording), [Layered Policy Design](Layered-policy-design), and [Privacy-Aware Network Client](Privacy-aware-network-client).. As this pattern keeps users informed of processed data, as well as what can be derived, and [Privacy Dashboard](Privacy-dashboard) provides collective summaries of such data, these patterns can work together. In doing so, users are better equipped to take actions which are in line with their personal privacy preferences. Similar to this argument is the benefit of [Trust Evaluation of Services Sides](Trust-Evaluation-of-Services-Sides), which highlights criteria which a service meets to build trust in the user. With this pattern, it can also inform the user of which parties with access to their data comply with these criteria.. This pattern and its components also work well with visual cues like [Appropriate Privacy Icons](Appropriate-Privacy-Icons), [Icons for Privacy Policies](Icons-for-Privacy-Policies), and [Privacy Color Coding](Privacy-color-coding). These assist in providing awareness quickly through easily interpreted visual information.. As this pattern seeks to inform users of policies in addition to notifying them of important information, it benefits from the application of accessible policies. Patterns which therefore _complement_ this pattern include [Privacy Aware Wording](Privacy-Aware-Wording), [Layered Policy Design](Layered-policy-design), and [Privacy-Aware Network Client](Privacy-aware-network-client).. This pattern is a compound pattern, one which builds off of its component patterns. These include:. - [Impactful Information and Feedback](Impactful-Information-and-Feedback);. - [Increasing Awareness of Information Aggregation](Increasing-Awareness-of-Information-Aggregation);. - [Privacy Awareness Panel](Privacy-Awareness-Panel);. - [Appropriate Privacy Feedback](Appropriate-Privacy-Feedback); and. - [Who's Listening](Whos-Listening)." ;

This may also entail additional metadata, such as factors pertaining to the expected audience, social comparisons against similar users or ones which the user in question has connected with. All users from which the analysis is derived should also first have provided their explicit, informed, and freely-given consent.. Search for strings which are likely to heighten the sensitivity of the content, and evaluate this against the expected audience. Where users disregard warnings, take note for improvement of future predictions through a feedback loop. Additionally, allow users to signify that despite ignoring the warning, they later regretted the post (or detect deletions which imply this) to distinguish false positives from inaccurate warnings.. One way to increase user understanding of the risks involved is to demonstrate by example a disclosure which matches the approximated sensitivity or contextual appropriateness of their content. This example will need to be one which they could usually view on their own, so as not to inadvertently cross the boundary of another user's privacy. This approach is also susceptible to inaccuracies, and would also need to be improved overall by the userbase.. The learning algorithm may at first be trained using text mining from logs of users who have opted-in to the, at first, experimental feature. While assumptions may be made, possibly inaccurately, users could also give feedback about regretted submissions or contextual appropriateness. Which type of learning is chosen is dependent on what information the controller has at their disposal at the time. If starting fresh, the implementation will likely be less sophisticated. While if available, solutions can be as complex as a reinforced classification learning algorithm." ;

The more that these users participate, explicitly providing context and implicitly providing metadata (e.g. statistics and telemetry), the better the controller fares in a number of respects.

As the controller should recognise the necessity of specific, informed, and freely given [Lawful Consent](Lawful-Consent), users are made aware of the pitfalls of such a system. As they are informed, perhaps through a combination of a [Privacy Dashboard](Privacy-Dashboard) or [Awareness Feed](Awareness-Feed), users may balance the privacy related tradeoffs.. This minimises the privacy risks taken according to the user's personal informed choices, and protects the controller from inadvertently undermining the user's privacy. The controller still desires participation, however, and may therefore make additional concessions or provisions to help make the tradeoff worthwhile or non-existent.

Users should be properly informed of the possible consequences of 'mixing it up'.. In order to ensure that recommendations made by the system do not have increasingly negative side effects, the system should learn from ineffective suggestions. This is limited to where it has permission to do so. Where user activity drops, a system should aim not continue in the same fashion as before. When it climbs, however, the system should improve whatever characteristics likely resulted in that climb.. This can be made more explicit by soliciting feedback from the user themselves, as also suggested by Shümmer. Even this, though, is subject to negative reactions.

As an additional measure, or where equality is not feasible, provide an alternative incentive. If not social, then financial incentives (discounts, waived fees) can be provided to active users.

User retention examples tend to be less frequent, with the odd website sending 'come back' emails which promise fee reductions.. >_Note that attempting to pinpoint users based on activity levels may reveal more sensitive characteristics, and as such should in any case require their prior informed consent_.. Another approach is the explicit provision of virtual currency necessary to benefit from the system, those who contribute will then have more currency at their disposal.

At the same time, the user should not be exposed to deep, complex, and lengthy detail unless they choose to review it further. Instead, concise and clear explanations should be used. One approach to this is to provide a hypothetical example in which a controller reveals surprising characteristics about a user from combinations of data, which alone are less informative.. Consider the use of user tests to determine the level of clarity an explanation or example provides. It is important that if a user chooses to accept the risks (and benefits) of aggregation, then they do so knowingly.

Security footage around a controller's premises, or fraud detection, for example, cannot reasonably be made optional to users of the service (or product).

The Controller must ensure that the Provider of the Sensor Network provides any potential users with unambiguous warning of the collection, and that individual consent is infeasible.

A couple unrelated words strung together can be a very secure yet memorable password.. These aspects can be weighted together to provide the user with a strength meter, as well as the explanations behind it. Examples of secure passwords should also be provided, but not accepted as the actual password. Do not enforce the use of special characters and numbers. Length, along with sufficient variation, should be the deciding factor in password strength.. Given enough resources and time however, state of the art character lengths can be overcome. It is as such useful to change them more regularly than the time it would take to brute force them. Otherwise, the longer that a password remains unchanged, the more likely it is that the password has been compromised.. Therefore a mechanism should also be provided to remind a user when it is time to start thinking of a new password. Based on how strong the original was this may be more or less often. [Unusual Activities](Unusual-activities) may also justify a more frequent update..

Additionally, various jurisdictions supply varying compliance requirements, and these controllers need to cater to every market they provide to.. Doing otherwise, possibly by disinterest or negligence, may have financial consequences in addition to potential public outcry.

Fire Eagle allows user to provide location information to applications using eight different \"levels\" of granularity in their [hierarchy](http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/developer/documentation/location):. * No information. * As precise as possible. * Postal code. * Neighborhood. * Town. * Region. * State. * Country.

    msc:problem "Many location-based services collect current or ongoing location information from a user in order to provide some contextual service (nearest coffee shop; local weather; etc.). Collecting more information than is necessary can harm the user's privacy and increase the risk for the service (in the case of a security breach, for example), but location data may still need to be collected to provide the service. Similarly, users may want the advantages of sharing their location from your service to friends or to some other service, but sharing very precise information provides a much greater risk to users (of re-identification, stalking, physical intrusion, etc.).. Accepting or transmitting location data at different levels of granularity generally requires a location hierarchy or geographic ontology agreed upon by both services and a more complex data storage model than simple digital coordinates.. Truncating latitude and longitude coordinates to a certain number of decimal places may decrease precision, but is generally not considered a good fuzzing algorithm. (For example, if a user is moving in a straight line and regularly updating their location, truncated location information will occasionally reveal precise location when the user crosses a lat/lon boundary.) Similarly, using \"town\" rather than lat/lon may occasionally reveal more precise data than expected when the user crosses a border between two towns." ;
    msc:requirement "Users want the benefits of sharing their location with friends or another service, but minimize the risk to user privacy." ;
    msc:sim "" ;
    msc:solution "Since much geographic data inherently has different levels of precision (see [geographic ontologies](Geographic ontologies), for example) -- like street, city, county, state, country -- there may be natural divisions in the precision of location data. By collecting or distributing only the necessary level of granularity, a service may be able to maintain the same functionality without requesting or distributing potentially sensitive data. A local weather site can access only the user's zip code to provide relevant weather without ever accessing precise (and therefore sensitive) location information.. A similar pattern is [location fuzzing](Fuzzing) which uses an algorithm to decrease the accuracy of location data without changing its lat/lon precision. This may be useful if the application only functions on latitude/longitude data, but can be vulnerable to attack.. In some cases, less granular data may also better capture the intent of a user (that tweet was about Sproul Plaza in general, not that particular corner) or be more meaningful to a recipient (\"Nick is in Berkeley, CA\" means more to my DC relatives than the particular intersection). For more along these lines, see, for example, [the Meaningful Location Project](http://www.meloproject.com/team)." ;

Regarding use of service, some criteria could be considered non-exhaustively: feedback on content, frequency of contributions, the use of service for a minimum duration, access to a service earlier than others, or use of special features within the service..

Let us assume that CatalogExample has placed P3P policies on all their pages, and that Claudia is using a Web browser with P3P built in._. _Claudia types the address for CatalogExample into her Web browser. Her browser is able to automatically fetch the P3P policy for that page. The policy states that the only data the site collects on its home page is the data found in standard HTTP access logs. Now Claudia's Web browser checks this policy against the preferences Claudia has given it. Is this policy acceptable to her, or should she be notified? Let's assume that Claudia has told her browser that this is acceptable. In this case, the homepage is displayed normally, with no pop-up messages appearing. Perhaps her browser displays a small icon somewhere along the edge of its window to tell her that a privacy policy was given by the site, and that it matched her preferences._. _Next, Claudia clicks on a link to the site's online catalog. The catalog section of the site has some more complex software behind it. This software uses cookies to implement a \"shopping cart\" feature. Since more information is being gathered in this section of the Web site, the Web server provides a separate P3P policy to cover this section of the site. Again, let's assume that this policy matches Claudia's preferences, so she gets no pop-up messages. Claudia continues and selects a few items she wishes to purchase. Then she proceeds to the checkout page._. _The checkout page of CatalogExample requires some additional information: Claudia's name, address, credit card number, and telephone number. Another P3P policy is available that describes the data that is collected here and states that her data will be used only for completing the current transaction, her order._. _Claudia's browser examines this P3P policy. Imagine that Claudia has told her browser that she wants to be warned whenever a site asks for her telephone number. In this case, the browser will pop up a message saying that this Web site is asking for her telephone number, and explaining the contents of the P3P statement. Claudia can then decide if this is acceptable to her. If it is acceptable, she can continue with her order; otherwise she can cancel the transaction._. _Alternatively, Claudia could have told her browser that she wanted to be warned only if a site is asking for her telephone number and was going to give it to third parties and/or use it for uses other than completing the current transaction. In that case, she would have received no prompts from her browser at all, and she could proceed with completing her order._" ;

These users should however be made to understand the risks involved in all the processing. Typically users need to be encouraged to review what data a service uses, and whether they consent to this.

    msc:examples "A Groupware Calendar System (GCS), 'Augur', Tullio, J., Goeckes, J., Mynatt, E.D, and Nguyen, D.H. Augmenting Shared Personal Calendars. Submitted to UIST'02 Paris, France.. History: This example logs all access to the shared calendars by the group members, and if the calendar is public, especially the users which are not expected to do so. The sharing of these calendars produces social norm information, that is, social trends from how members use the information, spread it, or dismiss it. This includes the usual when/how/what/etc. information around access. As the members are presented this analysis, they are given the ability to react to it, and adjust the sharing or details within their calendars to their privacy needs.. Feedback: Augur informs users who accessed the calendar, when, where, and what in particular was seen. This is especially useful for shared calendars since the feedback mechanism allows users of the calendar to adjust what they add to it, or who is permitted access the information.. While a GCS notification, or information display could reside anywhere, the 'native habitat' for calendar related information is in the calendar application, a mail application, or if the user chooses and if necessary, the area where time sensitive notifications usually appear.. Awareness: Users are given information at the chosen detail and notification levels in order to feel comfortable with the system. Since monitoring can negatively impact the users, the level of this is also configurable.. Accountability: Social norms around mutual understanding of what will/has been accessed in this example will affect calendar viewing and sharing. Prying into other's affairs without reasonable explanation could have social (or other) consequences. This includes a distinction between occasional viewing and constant checks. This may result in less information being shared, different access control settings, or an inquiry into the usage, which may address underlying issues.. Change: Being able to see cause and effect around different personal data sharing, hiding, or specific information flows, will likely bring about changes in how users use the shared calendar system. Important information may be shared while leaving less important details out, increasing efficiency." ;

    msc:feedback "A distinction is suggested between notifications which require 'glancing', 'looking', or 'interacting'. Examples of these in an Android system are toast notifications (ambient display), heads up notifications (in the status bar), and pop up notifications, respectively. Ideally, each level will be available to cater to a user's personal preference. Information about a certain context should by default be found in the location where users would naturally look for it.. In feedback, how should different senses be addressed, to what level, where should it be shown, for how long, etc. These are aspects which should ideally be user configurable, with reasonable defaults. This should cater to what each user determines is important." ;
    msc:forcesconcerns "- Controllers want users to take note of important notifications, particularly if it prevents users from over or under sharing. - Many users are complacent with not knowing about what a service does with their data, maintaining a disinterest in details. - Users may experience notification fatigue, if they are frequently provided with warnings and access notifications. - Users perceive information and notification appropriateness differently, depending on various contexts. An approach to this transparency which is both noticeable and yet unobtrusive is needed. One which is passively assertive. A purely technical solution is not appropriate, it must also consider physical and social contexts..

The data provided to the notified users should not intrude on other users' sensitive information, apart from the activities which involve the notified users.. The right balance needs to be met, both in the selected defaults and in the minimum and maximum levels available to the users in settings. The settings should be found easily, as should additional information. Balanced defaults can be determined from identified norms among users, while minimums should cater to the least interested and maximums to those most interested in their data's usage.. Users should ideally be able to choose the medium for the notifications, and for information retrieval, which best suits them. Candidates include email, push notifications on mobile devices, or simply from the same interface as the rest of the system.. An effort can be made to slowly introduce users to this system. For example, starting out more privately and then gradually revealing future information so that users have time to adjust their usage. This way users are less likely to portray an undesirable usage pattern.. These correlations may also be stored in a secure way, so that they cannot be viewed arbitrarily by backend users. If users are given assurances about what information can be seen by who, including backend users, they will be more willing to make use of the information and notification system." ;

This is in proportion to the weighted effort of the feature determined earlier.. The way in which users reciprocate is up to specific implementation. It may include required effort (satisfied by certain activities) before their activity's resulting benefit is realized. Alternatively it may prevent additional beneficial activities until they contribute. It may also make their discrepancy public, allowing the users to determine tolerable thresholds. In all these cases it is useful to keep track of each user's ratio within each collaboration mode they feature..

For example, it relies on accurate identification of suspicious [activity] based on meta information, where the meta information including the IP address can be spoofed by an experienced attacker._. _If the fallback multi-factor authentication only happens occasionally to the legitimate account owner, they may be unprepared to [handle] such authentication, leading to [decreased] usability._" ;
    msc:context "Services (or products), particularly over the Internet, tend to use username and password based authentication. This security mechanism proves most convenient for users, as it is commonplace and simple compared to the more secure alternatives. It is also subject to common shortcomings, however. Passwords become less secure the longer they remain unchanged, are often vulnerable to brute force, snooping, and phishing attacks, and cannot be proven to be held solely by the user.. This complicates the certainty of the authentication, and thereby the authenticity of any decision made by the user, including consent. Controllers may also derive additional factors, however, such as device or access specific information. If location is provided, for example, it may hint at unlikely account activity." ;
    msc:examples "1. _Gmail_. - _Gmail displays information about other sessions (if any) in the footer, linking to a page named \"Activity on this account\" which lists other sessions and recent activities to the Gmail account.

The disable takes about a week, \"to make sure the bad guys aren't the ones who turned off your alerts.\"_. 2. _Facebook_. - _When Facebook detects an unusual sign-in, it shows 'social authentication' that displays a few pictures of the user's friends and asks the user to name the person in those photos._. 3. _Dropbox_. - _The 'Security' tab of the 'Settings' of the Dropbox website displays all web browser sessions logged in to the account, and enables the user to log out one or more of them. The name of the browser, operating system, and the IP address and corresponding country are displayed to help the user make a choice._. - _It also displays all devices that are linked to the account, and allows the user to unlink one or more of them._" ;

Their decision is based on the assumption that it is very unlikely for a hacker to recognize the friends.

Apart from these, the website can get the IP address of the user, which may be mapped to a certain country/area through GeoIP. [These] can be used to tell if a browser is 'new' to the website. The website can have its rules to determine if an access is 'suspicious', for example, an access from a new country / browser / operating system is considered suspicious._. _By running native code, the application can [consensually] collect some [device identifiers], including the operating system environment settings (e.g. the list of running processes), the hardware parameters (such as the ID of the CPU), and device UUIDs (provided by mobile operating systems like iOS).

The service can have its rules to determine if a sign-in is 'suspicious', for example, an access from a new country / [device] / operating system is considered suspicious._. * _Require Multi-factor Authentication_. _In case of a suspicious [activity], multi-factor authentication may be a way to let the legitimate user in. The service can request [further authentication], such as:_. - _A software token_. - _Examples include Google Authenticator which runs on mobile phones and implements RFC6238 TOTP security tokens._. - _A hardware token (disconnected)_. - _Examples include a token issued by a bank which displays digits, which is similar to a software token._. - _A hardware token (connected)_. - _The token may exchange a longer secondary password than the previous one, which means it's safer._. - _Personal data like date of birth, [or civil identification]._. - _Obviously not a good choice here because it cannot be changed._. - _An one-time password (OTP) sent to the registered E-mail address / mobile phone_. - _Depending [on] the type of the service, [the user may use] the same password for the E-mail address, or [may lose their mobile phone]._. _Using multi-factor authentication only in case of suspicious [activity] is more convenient [than] using it all the time, but is less secure._. * _Notify Account Holders of Unusual Activities_. _When a suspicious sign-in is detected, it may be a sign that the password has already been leaked. Depending on the type of the service, it can notify the user about the suspicious sign-in through E-mail, telephone, or other means._. _Here the immediate notification can also be used in the multi-factor authentication._. _For services that can be logged on from multiple devices at the same time, the user should be able to check the existence of other sessions, and review recent [activity]._" ;

Each user may be shown using some identifier easily recognizable by other users, such as a randomly selected avatar (e.g. Gravitar), initial(s), username, or profile picture. The same may identify unauthenticated users as 'anonymous'.. Where historic views are provided, the same consistent identifier can be shown next to differential changes along with timestamps. The ability to edit, remove, or anonymize a contribution may also be available if desired. Details of these extra features, or justification for the lack of user ability to perform these actions, should be provided prior to usage." ;

    msc:relatedpatterns "This pattern is a component of the compound pattern, [Awareness Feed](Awareness-Feed). As such, this pattern _may be used_ by it.. This pattern _complements_ [Privacy Awareness Panel](Privacy-Awareness-Panel), [Appropriate Privacy Feedback](Appropriate-Privacy-Feedback), [Buddy List](Buddy-List), and [Reciprocity](Reciprocity).. [Privacy Awareness Panel](Privacy-Awareness-Panel), like this pattern, shows disclosed information access. It specifically allows monitoring what access is occurring and how it might become identifying. Comparatively, this pattern allows for monitoring who accesses the same content as the user. These could work together to have a more complete solution which covers released and accessed content monitoring. [Appropriate Privacy Feedback](Appropriate-Privacy-Feedback) is another pattern which tries to show who can see disclosed content. It however adds the possibility of knowing how the data might be used, providing useful feedback to the user. These patterns may work together in a similar fashion.. It also _may use_ Schümmer's Activity Counter for anonymous information aggregation which does not reveal receiver identify. The same holds for Elephant’s Brain, which can log information of user activity. It also _refines_ the Magic Document pattern (Volter 2003), which to a lessor extent ensures that collaborative users are aware of accessed information." ;
